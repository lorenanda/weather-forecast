# Time series analysis to forecast the temperature in Berlin

This project was completed in week 5 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin.

## Description
The goal is to forecast the daily weather in Berlin Mitte over one year using autoregressive models and to plot climate data on a map. For the forecast, I used linear regression, auto-regressive and (Auto-)ARIMA models, as well as the Prophet library. I mapped the temperature values with the Folium library.
